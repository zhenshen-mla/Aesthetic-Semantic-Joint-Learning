  Implementation of Paperï¼šJOINT LEARNING OF IMAGE AESTHETIC QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND SEMANTIC RECOGNITION BASED ON FEATURE ENHANCEMENT //ICASSP2021   
  
## Introduction
  In this paper, We explore the relationships between aesthetic quality assessment and semantic recognition task, and employ a multi-task convolutional neural network with feature enhancement mechanism to effectively integrate these two tasks. A novel Enhanced Aggregation of Features Network (EAFNet) for joint learning on aesthetic quality assessment and semantic recognition is proposed, which boosting of valid features and suppression of invalid features for each task in both channel and spatial dimensions. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets well verify the superior performance of EAFNet in handling aesthetic quality assessment and semantic recognition tasks.
